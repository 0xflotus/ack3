# How to contribute to ack

## Requesting new filetypes

We get many requests for new filetypes.  Not all filetypes will necessarily be added to ack.

If you'd like to suggest a new filetype for ack, please create an issue that includes:

* The name of the filetype
* What the definition of the filetype would be, taken from the `.ackrc` file that you've been using.
* URL of a web page that discusses what the filetype is
* What the file contains, and why it should be a filetype
* How widely used this filetype will be.

Please do not create a pull request for it.
